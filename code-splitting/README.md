## Project Setup

This project assumes you have [NodeJS v8](http://nodejs.org/) or greater installed. You should
also have [npm v5](https://www.npmjs.com/) or greater installed as well (this comes packaged
with Node 8). You'll also need a recent version of [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
as well.

You may have come to this project from different varying sources. There are a
different series of branches for each workshop/course I've done. To get started with
the project, start with this:

1. [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a GitHub Account (if you don't already have one)
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo
3. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork
4. In the directory you cloned the repository, run `git fetch --all`

## Getting Started
These steps will assume that you have `cd`'d in your preferred editor to this repositories cloned location.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
